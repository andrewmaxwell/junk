    <p>This app does billions of calculations per second to simulate the paths of light rays through a simple scene. Over time, it produces an increasingly photorealistic scene created purely by math.</p>
    <p>It uses no GPU or hardware acceleration. When the page loads, each CPU core is given instructions on how to render single, low-quality approximations of the scene and send them to the screen as fast as they can, over and over. Over time, they add up to a higher quality image.</p>
