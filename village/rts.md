Village RTS

You start out with:
Some number of workers
Some number of children
A town hall (for basic storage)
Enough houses for the starting people

Farms:
- To make a farm, workers must till the ground
- Tilled ground slowly grows grain
- Once grain is fully grown, workers can harvest it
- Once grain is harvested, a worker must take it to the town hall or a granary (which must have space for it)

Workers:
- Automatically consume stored grain
- Move fast when < 10% hunger
- Reproduce after X amount of time when < 50% hunger
- Die when 100% hunger
- Upgrades:
  - Increase speed of tilling
  - Increase speed of harvesting
  - Increase resource carrying capacity

Children:
- Automatically consume stored grain
- Grow up into workers if there is enough housing (1 house for every X workers)
- Die when 100% hunger

Buildings:
- Town hall (for general upgrades, can also store other resources)
- Farm land (by tilling)
- Granary (for storing food)
- Houses (for more people)
